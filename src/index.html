        <span>A Poem by&nbsp;</span><span>George Gordon Byron</span>
      </h2>
    <p class="poem__stanza">
        I had a dream, which was not all a dream.<br>
    The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars<br>
    Did wander darkling in the eternal space,<br>
    Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth<br>
    Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;<br>
     Morn came and went - and came, and brought no day,<br>
    </p><hr class="poem__rule">
    <p class="poem__stanza">
        And men forgot their passions in the dread<br>
    Of this their desolation; and all hearts<br>
    Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:<br>
    And they did live by watchfires - and the thrones,<br>
    The palaces of crowned kings - the huts,<br>
    The habitations of all things which dwell,<br>
    Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,<br>
    And men were gathered round their blazing homes<br>
    </p><hr class="poem__rule">
    <p class="poem__stanza">
       To look once more into each other's face;<br>
    Happy were those who dwelt within the eye<br>
    Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:<br>
    A fearful hope was all the World contained;<br>
    Forests were set on fire - but hour by hour<br>
    They fell and faded - and the crackling trunks<br>
    Extinguished with a crash - and all was black.<br>
    The brows of men by the despairing light<br>
    Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits<br>
    The flashes fell upon them; some lay down<br>
    And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest<br>
    Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;<br>
    And others hurried to and fro, and fed<br>
    Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up<br>
    With mad disquietude on the dull sky,<br>
    The pall of a past World; and then again<br>
    With curses cast them down upon the dust,<br>
    And gnashed their teeth and howled: the wild birds shrieked,<br>
   </p><hr class="poem__rule">
   <p class="poem__stanza">
        And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,<br>
    And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes<br>
    Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled<br>
    And twined themselves among the multitude,<br>
    Hissing, but stingless - they were slain for food:<br>
    And War, which for a moment was no more,<br>
    Did glut himself again: - a meal was bought<br>
    With blood, and each sate sullenly apart<br>
    Gorging himself in gloom: no Love was left;<br>
    All earth was but one thought - and that was Death,<br>
    Immediate and inglorious; and the pang<br>
    Of famine fed upon all entrails - men<br>
    Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;<br>
    The meagre by the meagre were devoured,<br>
    Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,<br>
    And he was faithful to a corse, and kept<br>
    The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,<br>
    Till hunger clung them,[57] or the dropping dead<br>
    Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,<br>
  </p><hr class="poem__rule">
  <p class="poem__stanza">
        But with a piteous and perpetual moan,<br>
    And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand<br>
    Which answered not with a caress - he died.<br>
    The crowd was famished by degrees; but two<br>
    Of an enormous city did survive,<br>
    And they were enemies: they met beside<br>
    The dying embers of an altar-place<br>
    Where had been heaped a mass of holy things<br>
    For an unholy usage; they raked up,<br>
    And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands<br>
    The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath<br>
    Blew for a little life, and made a flame<br>
    Which was a mockery; then they lifted up<br>
    Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld[58]<br>
    Each other's aspects - saw, and shrieked, and died -<br>
  </p><hr class="poem__rule">
  <p class="poem__stanza">
       Even of their mutual hideousness they died,<br>
    Unknowing who he was upon whose brow<br>
    Famine had written Fiend. The World was void,<br>
    The populous and the powerful was a lump,<br>
    Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless -<br>
    A lump of death - a chaos of hard clay.<br>
    The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,<br>
    And nothing stirred within their silent depths;<br>
    Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,<br>
    And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropped<br>
    They slept on the abyss without a surge -<br>
    The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,<br>
    The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;<br>
    The winds were withered in the stagnant air,<br>
    And the clouds perished; Darkness had no need<br>
    Of aid from them - She was the Universe.<br>
